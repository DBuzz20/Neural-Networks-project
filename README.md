# Machine Learning Project - Neural Networks
Project for the "Optimization Methods for Machine Learning" course.

Master's degree course in "Business Intelligence and Analytics" (Management engineering's curricula).

## Project Description
The project, developed in `Python`, involves the implementation of various approaches and techniques regarding `Neural Networks` in machine learning, putting particular emphasis on the optimization side of the developement.

In particular, the project required knowing and coding 

## Files
The `Assignment` folder contains all the details about the requests of each question, togheter with an image of the expected plot that my code should produce after the training.
The 'Code' folder presents the actual code, divided by question. In it, are also available the plots produced by each question's implementation 
Also, the `Final_report.pdf` file describes the approach followed when developing such questions, explaining the decisions taken, with an eye on the over/under fitting possibilities, and all the performance results of such implementations (both in time and precision).
The report also provides various graphs and comments about the development, including a final comparison between all the developed techiniques.
